# SomethingTM
It do something
My (JKF31 Jake Fulton) notebook take's an input of a user's name and an integer.
If they don't enter an integer it loops and keeps asking for an integer.
Then it prints their name the number of times of the number they entered.

My (RYL50 Ryan Liang) program asks the user for their name and their favorite food. Afterwards it prints out that their favorite food is not whatever they claim to be
their favorite food and tells them to eat an onion

My (ABS199 Abdulrafay Syed) program asks the user for their age.  Then, it prints out a sentence stating how old they are.
Our group has Jake Fulton, Ryan Liang, and Rafay Syed
